### Release Checklist

Some unfortunately non-automated tasks that need to be done manually:

1. Run test:all and make sure jest + mocha browser tests are passing (you'll need to check mocha tests in the browser)
2. Make sure the types in types/index.d.ts are updated manually because they're not getting autogenerated atm
3. Make sure readme is up-to-date
   
### Beta Version

Publish a beta version by doing something like:

`npm version 3.0.0-beta1`
`npm publish --tag beta`

When making an actual release, provide an associated commit message to explain what the release does:

`npm version patch -m "Upgrade to %s for reasons"`
